"""Seed and verify the mailbox logins that the scheduled warm-up run will use.

A scheduled run has no access to the user's normal browser, so it drives its own Playwright
profile. The user signs in once, by hand, into THAT profile; the session persists there and
every later run reuses it.

    seed_login.py list
    seed_login.py seed gmail
    seed_login.py seed https://mail.example.com --name work
    seed_login.py check                 # every seeded provider
    seed_login.py check gmail

Signed-in status is decided by loading the mailbox and reading the final URL, never by
looking for a cookie. Auth cookies outlive the session they belong to, so a cookie test
reports a mailbox as signed in while it is redirecting to a login form - which is exactly
how a warm-up can log sends it never made.
